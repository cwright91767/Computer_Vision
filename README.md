# Computer_Vision
Collection of Computer Vision projects by Cassie Wright Jr.

## Introduction
Below is a collection of Computer Vision projects that I've completed. Several were done as part of the OMSCS program at Georgia Institute of Technology. To maintain academic integrity, code for thse particular projects is NOT included here.

### Face Detection & Tracking
Description: The video below employs the native tools of OpenCV to identify a human face and track it as it moves.

Methodology: Fast face detection using deep learning, Caffe, and the Single Shot Detector framework.

Tools used:
* Unordered sub-list

Python 3.7.1
            OpenCV 3.4.3
            PyCharm 2018.2

### Augmented Reality
Description: This shows a "natural scene" (which happens to be a wall in my living room, decorated with images) that contains a defined blank area in which an "advertisement" will be inserted.
This was my final project for CS6476: Introduction to Computer Vision at Georgia Tech's OMSCS program.

Methodology 1: Hough Lines & Harris Corners
Methodology 2: OpenCV Contours --> this produced MUCH BETTER results

Tools used: Python 2.7.13
            OpenCV 2.4.13
            Numpy 1.13.1

Code: This was my final project at Georgia Tech, therefore code is not included here.
